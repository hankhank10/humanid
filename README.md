# humanid
 
This is a short example python script showing how to generate a human readable, human memorable, quasi-unique ID from humanid.hankapi.com

Full documentation on the API is available at http://humanid.hankapi.com

The API generates keys which are *extremely* likely to be unique since they are randomly generated from 1.4 trillion different combinations, but they are not centrally logged and there is no guarantee that word combinations will not be repeated

This code and the API is provided for education purposes and without any sort of guarantee
